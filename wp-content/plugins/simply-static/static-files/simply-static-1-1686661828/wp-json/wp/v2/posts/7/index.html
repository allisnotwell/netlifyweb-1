The poll also found Trump continues to lead his rivals for the party\u2019s presidential nomination by a wide margin.<\/p>\n<p>Some 43 per cent of self-identified Republicans said Trump was their preferred candidate, compared to 22 per cent who picked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump\u2019s closest rival. In early May, Trump led DeSantis 49 per cent to 19 per cent, but that was before DeSantis formally entered the race.<\/p>\n<p>Trump accuses President Joe Biden, a Democrat, of orchestrating the federal case to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign. Biden has kept his distance from the case and declines to comment on it.<\/p>\n<p>Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey and an adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, was asked during a CNN townhall on Monday night if he thought the Biden Administration was weaponizing the Department of Justice against Trump.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThis evidence looks pretty damning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Miami Braces for Crowd<\/p>\n<p>Trump spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Georgia over the weekend and his campaign said he would make a statement on Tuesday night, when he returns to New Jersey.<\/p>\n<p>With memories fresh of the 6 January, 2021, assault by Trump supporters on the US Capitol, officials have raised security concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Miami police chief Manny Morales said the city was planning for a crowd size of up to 50,000 people and would close roads in the downtown area if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith accuses Trump of taking thousands of papers containing some of the nation\u2019s most sensitive national-security secrets when he left the White House in January 2021 and storing them in a haphazard manner at his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate, according to a grand jury indictment released last week.<\/p>\n<p>As special counsel, Smith, who is heading the case, is given a greater degree of independence than other Justice Department prosecutors, to try to minimize political factors. He is also investigating Trump\u2019s effort to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden.<\/p>\n<p>Photos included in the indictment show boxes of documents stored on a ballroom stage, in a bathroom and strewn across a storage-room floor.<\/p>\n<p>The indictment alleges Trump lied to officials who tried to get them back.<\/p>\n<p>Trump is the first former or current president to face criminal charges, but legal experts say that does not prevent him from running for president &#8211; or taking office even if he is found guilty.<\/p>\n<p>Legal experts, including Trump\u2019s former attorney general William Barr, say the case is a strong one. The charges include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes unauthorized possession of defense information, and conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>Any federal trial in Florida may not take place until after the November 2024 presidential election. Trump also is due to go on trial in March 2024 in a separate case in New York state court, stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in Miami on Monday to face federal criminal charges, while a new Reuters\/Ipsos poll found a vast majority of his fellow Republicans believe the case to be politically motivated.
