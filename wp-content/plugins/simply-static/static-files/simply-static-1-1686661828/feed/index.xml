										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kylian Mbappe told Paris Saint-Germain on Monday that he would not be taking up an option to extend his contract until 2025, raising the spectre of him following Lionel Messi out of the club this summer.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old France striker&#8217;s current deal expires at the end of next season, with the option of another year.</p>
<p>If he does not sign, the French champions risk losing him for nothing in a year&#8217;s time &#8212; so they could now sell him this summer rather than miss out on a windfall for one of the world&#8217;s best players.</p>
<p>Mbappe&#8217;s decision not to renew, announced in a letter to the club and revealed by the French sports daily L&#8217;Equipe, is a fresh blow to PSG following the loss of Messi to Inter Miami.</p>
<p>There had been a deadline of 23 July, 2023, for Mbappe to decide.</p>
<p>Mbappe&#8217;s move comes a little over a year since he snubbed Real Madrid by signing a surprise extension to his contract to remain at the Parc des Princes.</p>
<p>Real would again be chief among his suitors.</p>
<p>Mbappe&#8217;s entourage did not respond immediately when asked late Monday evening.</p>
<p>The striker&#8217;s departure for free at the end of his current contract, in the summer of 2024, would prove catastrophic for PSG.</p>
<p>In addition to the void left in the team, the club would also be deprived of the millions of euros a transfer would earn.</p>
<p>The future of Brazilian fellow star striker Neymar, under contract until 2025, also appears vague ahead of what is shaping up to be a summer of upheaval in the French capital.</p>
<p>Growing doubts over future<br />
Mbappe joined PSG on a season-long loan from Monaco in August 2017 that turned into a permanent deal worth 180 million euros ($194 million).</p>
<p>He helped France to World Cup glory as a teenager in 2018 and has established himself as arguably the leading forward on the global stage.</p>
<p>Mbappe also scored a hat-trick in France&#8217;s 2022 World Cup final defeat to Messi&#8217;s Argentina and helped Paris Saint-Germain win a record 11th French title.<br />
But Mbappe hinted last month that he could leave in 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said that next year I will play at PSG. I still have a year of contract so I will honour my contract,&#8221; he said when asked about his future at an awards ceremony where he was voted the Ligue 1 player of the season for the fourth successive time.</p>
<p>At Clairefontaine, where France are preparing for their next Euro qualifying matches, the striker appeared relaxed on Monday.</p>
<p>Smiling and joking with coach Didier Deschamps and fellow attacker Antoine Griezmann, he participated in afternoon training and signed dozens of autographs for spectators.</p>
<p>The announcement of Mbappe&#8217;s intentions to PSG are yet another annoyance for the club&#8217;s Qatari owners following a difficult season on and off the pitch, despite winning the French title.</p>
<p>After another failure in the Champions League, the club are working to find a successor to coach Christophe Galtier.</p>
<p>The season was widely seen as a disappointment after PSG were dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich in the last 16 and from the French Cup at the same stage.</p>
<p>As for Neymar, the Brazilian&#8217;s fitness has regularly been a concern for PSG, ever since he signed from Barcelona for a world-record fee of 222 million euros in 2017.</p>
<p>He has scored 118 goals in 173 games for PSG, but has missed more than 100 games due either to injury or suspension.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fans of K-pop megastars BTS flocked to hotspots around Seoul on Monday to mark the supergroup&#8217;s 10-year anniversary, with South Korea unveiling a special commemorative stamp series to celebrate.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s fans &#8212; known collectively as ARMY &#8212; gathered outside the offices of its agency HYBE to take selfies and record TikTok videos in front of a huge mural of the stars being painted on a wall.</p>
<p>Korea Post unveiled a special edition series of stamps in BTS&#8217;s honour set to go on sale at post offices today, Tuesday &#8212; the official anniversary of the septet&#8217;s debut &#8212; having already sold out almost instantly online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously BTS are global superstars, but we didn&#8217;t expect the stamps to be sold out on the day of the online release,&#8221; a Korea Post official told AFP.</p>
<p>After debuting on 13 June, 2013, the group went on to become the first all-South Korean act to dominate the US and UK charts, raking in billions of dollars and building a global fandom in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many ARMY BTS fans have asked for the release of BTS stamps, and we also wanted to issue stamps for these global artists for their 10th anniversary,&#8221; Kim Mi-hwa, Korea Post stamp designer, told AFP.</p>
<p>The band &#8212; currently on a hiatus, with two members performing their mandatory South Korean military service &#8212; released a new digital single last week to celebrate the anniversary.</p>
<p>The single, ‘Take Two’, is purportedly a nod to the band&#8217;s second chapter after a decade as musicians.<br />
Fans from around the world travelled to South Korea to celebrate the anniversary, with the Seoul city government running a special programme for the visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thrilling to be here. It&#8217;s thrilling to be surrounded by other ARMY,&#8221; scientist Anne Micic, 55, a BTS fan from Australia, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s the other thing, that as an ARMY when you meet other ARMY it&#8217;s almost like you have another family, which is really awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>A handwritten letter by J-Hope, who began his military duty in April, was uploaded Monday on Weverse, the worldwide fandom network.</p>
<p>The letter appeared to have been prepared in advance for the anniversary before he joined the military.</p>
<p>&#8220;I assume I&#8217;d be very military-disciplined&#8221; by the time the letter is revealed, he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what day it is, I sincerely thank you and love you,&#8221; he told fans.</p>
<p>&#8216;BTS saved my life&#8217;<br />
A special map released by the city government for fans visiting from abroad features 13 locations across the South Korean capital.</p>
<p>It includes agency HYBE&#8217;s office in Yongsan and the historic Gyeongbok Palace, where BTS filmed a special edition of the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</p>
<p>Fans said it was worth travelling so far to honour their favourite band.</p>
<p>BTS &#8220;really saved my life&#8221;, Claudia Agustin, 23, a fan from Indonesia who works in accounting, told AFP in Seoul, adding that their lyrics had spoken to her during difficult periods of her life.</p>
<p>She said she was &#8220;really, really proud&#8221; of the group&#8217;s 10-year anniversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how they&#8217;ve been struggling from back in their debut days and then they really make it big. Now everyone really knows them,&#8221; she added.<br />
Starting Monday, important tourist spots across Seoul, including the Namsan Seoul Tower and Dongdaemun Design Plaza, will be lit up in purple &#8212; ARMY&#8217;s colour &#8212; in celebration of the anniversary.</p>
<p>BTS members who are not doing their military service yet have been busy with their solo careers &#8212; with Jimin releasing his six-track solo album ‘Face’ in March.</p>
<p>It is likely part of a carefully planned strategy, experts said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most significant part of BTS&#8217; 10th anniversary is that they&#8217;re still here and together as BTS,&#8221; Jeff Benjamin, Billboard&#8217;s K-pop columnist, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every male K-pop group will need to pause or transition due to South Korea&#8217;s mandatory military service but not every group is adequately prepared as BTS has with preplanned music and content that holds significant meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the new song itself &#8216;Take Two&#8217; speaks specifically to this new chapter of BTS with their fans,&#8221; Benjamin added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in Miami on Monday to face federal criminal charges, while a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found a vast majority of his fellow Republicans believe the case to be politically motivated.</p>
<p>Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election, is scheduled to be in a Miami federal courthouse on Tuesday at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) for an initial appearance in the case.</p>
<p>Accused of unlawfully keeping US national-security documents and lying to officials who tried to recover them, Trump has proclaimed his innocence and vowed to continue his campaign to regain the presidency in a November 2024 election.</p>
<p>Trump, who turns 77 on Wednesday, touched down in Miami at 2:54 p.m. (1854 GMT) in a private jet with his name emblazoned on the side.</p>
<p>Supporters gathered outside a nearby golf club he owns, where he was due to stay the night.</p>
<p>“I HOPE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS WATCHING WHAT THE RADICAL LEFT ARE DOING TO AMERICA,” he wrote on his Truth Social social-media platform before departing from New Jersey.<br />
Trump’s legal woes have not affected his popularity among Republican voters.</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday found that 81 per cent of Republicans thought the charges were politically motivated. The poll also found Trump continues to lead his rivals for the party’s presidential nomination by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Some 43 per cent of self-identified Republicans said Trump was their preferred candidate, compared to 22 per cent who picked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump’s closest rival. In early May, Trump led DeSantis 49 per cent to 19 per cent, but that was before DeSantis formally entered the race.</p>
<p>Trump accuses President Joe Biden, a Democrat, of orchestrating the federal case to undermine Trump’s campaign. Biden has kept his distance from the case and declines to comment on it.</p>
<p>Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey and an adviser to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, was asked during a CNN townhall on Monday night if he thought the Biden Administration was weaponizing the Department of Justice against Trump.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Christie said. “This evidence looks pretty damning.”</p>
<p>Miami Braces for Crowd</p>
<p>Trump spoke to an enthusiastic crowd in Georgia over the weekend and his campaign said he would make a statement on Tuesday night, when he returns to New Jersey.</p>
<p>With memories fresh of the 6 January, 2021, assault by Trump supporters on the US Capitol, officials have raised security concerns.</p>
<p>Miami police chief Manny Morales said the city was planning for a crowd size of up to 50,000 people and would close roads in the downtown area if necessary.</p>
<p>Special Counsel Jack Smith accuses Trump of taking thousands of papers containing some of the nation’s most sensitive national-security secrets when he left the White House in January 2021 and storing them in a haphazard manner at his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate, according to a grand jury indictment released last week.</p>
<p>As special counsel, Smith, who is heading the case, is given a greater degree of independence than other Justice Department prosecutors, to try to minimize political factors. He is also investigating Trump’s effort to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden.</p>
<p>Photos included in the indictment show boxes of documents stored on a ballroom stage, in a bathroom and strewn across a storage-room floor.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges Trump lied to officials who tried to get them back.</p>
<p>Trump is the first former or current president to face criminal charges, but legal experts say that does not prevent him from running for president &#8211; or taking office even if he is found guilty.</p>
<p>Legal experts, including Trump’s former attorney general William Barr, say the case is a strong one. The charges include violations of the Espionage Act, which criminalizes unauthorized possession of defense information, and conspiracy to obstruct justice, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Any federal trial in Florida may not take place until after the November 2024 presidential election. Trump also is due to go on trial in March 2024 in a separate case in New York state court, stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star.</p>
